### Project Progression

The projects are ordered by the progression of the course, from easy to advanced.

1. [node_app](./node_app/): run minimum nodejs app with port mapping
2. [first_demo](./first-demo/): minimum nodejs app that returns a greeting message
3. [node_html_app](./node_html_app/): build and tag image, run container and expose port
4. [python-app](./python-app/): calculate BMI in an interactive shell
5. [assignment-1](./assignment-1/: dockerize a node app with exposed port, and python app with interactive cmd interface
6. [data-volumes](./data-volumes/): anonymous volume, named volume, bind mount
7. [networks](./networks/): create network and place containers into the same network. Expose port to outside if needed
8. [multi-container-app](./multi-container-app/): front-end, back-end, db container wired together
9. [utility-containers](./utility-containers): use docker to initialize things without global install
10. [laravel-php](./laravel-php): a non-trivial tech stack made easy by docker
11. [deployment](./deployment/): deploy a node app on EC2 and make it publicly viewable, push image to docker hub
